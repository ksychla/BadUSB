Lithuaia! My fatherland! You are like health,
How much you need to value, he will only find out
Who lost you. Today is your beauty in all its ornaments
I can see and describe because I miss you
Holy Virgin, you defend Jasna Czestochowa
And you shine in Ostra Brama! You, what a castle stronghold
You protect Nowogrodek with his faithful people!
How did you miraculously recover my child,
(When from a crying mother under your protection
Sacrificial, dead, I lifted my eyelid
And immediately I was able to walk to your doorstep temples
To go for the restored life to thank God),
This is how you will miraculously return us to the Motherland.
Meanwhile, carry my longing soul
To these forest hills, to these green meadows,
Spread wide over the blue Nemunas;
To these fields painted with various grains,
Gilded with wheat, silver-plated with rye
